# VRTK SDK

Unofficial fork of [VRTK](https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK) containing only the SDK abstractions: 
- access to inputs in an SDK agnostic way through `VRTK_SDK_Bridge`
- ability to switch SDK using `VRTK_SDKManager`.

The aim of this fork is to contain only the code that those functionalities depend on.
